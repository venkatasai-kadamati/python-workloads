### If you get a "RECORD file not found" error or Venv Package corrupted issue:

This means the package installation is broken. You must delete the files manually.

1. Open your File Explorer.
2. Navigate to your project's site-packages folder. Based on your error message, the path is:
   > C:\Users\venkatasai\central workstation\Python Codebase\.venv\Lib\site-packages\
3. Locate the specific package folder and delete it.
4. Reinstall the package.
